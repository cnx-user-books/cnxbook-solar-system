      Ignoring the occasional pre-telescopic appearance of
      exceptionally large <link document="m11970">sunspots</link>, the
      Moon is the only heavenly body which shows features to the naked
      eye--the Man in the Moon. These features are permanent, and it
      was therefore obvious that the Moon always keeps its same face
      turned to us (although there are minor perturbations that were
      not noticed until later). In the philosophy of Aristotle
      (384-322 BCE), these features presented somewhat of a
      problem. The heavens, starting at the Moon, were the realm of
      perfection, the sublunary region was the realm of change and
      corruption, and any resemblance between these regions was
      strictly ruled out. Aristotle himself suggested that the Moon
      partook perhaps of some contamination from the realm of
      corruption.

      Although Aristotle's natural philosophy was very influential in
      the Greek world, it was not without competitors and
      skeptics. Thus, in his little book <cite><cite-title>On the Face in the
      Moon's Orb</cite-title></cite>, the Greek writer Plutarch (46-120 CE)
      expressed rather different views on the relationship between the
      Moon and Earth. He suggested that the Moon had deep recesses in
      which the light of the Sun did not reach and that the spots are
      nothing but the shadows of rivers or deep chasms. He also
      entertained the possibility that the Moon was inhabited. In the
      following century, the Greek satirist Lucian (120-180 CE) wrote
      of an imaginary trip to the Moon, which was inhabited, as were
      the Sun and Venus.

    <para id="para3">
      The medieval followers of Aristotle, first in the Islamic world
      and then in Christian Europe, tried to make sense of the lunar
      spots in Aristotelian terms. Various possibilities were
      entertained. It had been suggested already in Antiquity that the
      Moon was a perfect mirror and that its markings were reflections
      of earthly features, but this explanation was easily dismissed
      because the face of the Moon never changes as it moves about the
      Earth. Perhaps there were vapors between the Sun and the Moon,
      so that the images were actually contained in the Sun's incident
      light and thus reflected to the Earth. The explanation that
      finally became standard was that there were variations of
      "density" in the Moon that caused this otherwise perfectly
      spherical body to appear the way it does. The perfection of the
      Moon, and therefore the heavens, was thus preserved.

    <para id="para4">
      It is a curious fact that although many symbolic images of the
      Moon survive in medieval and Renaissance works of art (usually a
      crescent), virtually no one bothered to represent the Moon with
      its spots the way it actually appeared. We only have a few rough
      sketches in the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (ca. 1500) and a
      <link resource="gilbert_moon.gif">drawing of the naked-eye
      moon</link> by the English physician <link document="m11985">William Gilbert</link>. None of these drawings
      found its way into print until well after the <link document="m11932">telescope</link> had come into astronomy.

    <para id="para5">
      The telescope delivered the coup de grace to attempts to explain
      away the Moon's spots and to the perfection of the heavens in
      general. With his telescope, Galileo saw not only the "ancient"
      spots, but many smaller ones never seen before. In these smaller
      spots, he saw that the width of the dark lines defining them
      varied with the angle of solar illumination. He watched the dark
      lines change and he saw light spots in the unilluminated part of
      the Moon that gradually merged with the illuminated part as this
      part grew. The conclusion he drew was that the changing dark
      lines were shadows and that the lunar surface has mountains and
      valleys. The Moon was thus not spherical and hardly perfect.

      Galileo was not the only observer of the Moon. Indeed, he was
      not the first. <link document="m11979">Thomas Harriot</link>
      drew the first telescopic representation of the Moon and
      observed our nearest neighbor for several years. His drawings,
      however, remained unpublished.
    </para>

    <para id="para7">
      Those who wished to defend the perfection of the heavens brought
      out the old argument about rarity and density. In the letter of
      the <link document="m11939">Collegio Romano</link>
      mathematicians to <link document="m11968">Cardinal
      Bellarmine</link> of April 1611, <link document="m11958">Christoph Clavius</link> (74 years old)
      expressed a minority opinion: "But it appears to Father Clavius
      more probable that the surface is not uneven, but rather that
      the lunar body is not of uniform density and has denser and
      rarer parts, as are the ordinary spots seen with the natural
      sight."<cite target-id="entry1"/> The other three <term target-id="jesu">Jesuit</term> mathematicians on the faculty of the college,
      however, believed that the lunar surface was indeed uneven. In
      this case the opposition faded away over the next few years.
    </para>

    <para id="para8">
      Galileo wrote in a letter, 1610, that he would like to make a
      series of representations of the Moon showing its changing
      phases. Presumably his purpose was to show how the shadows of
      individual features changed with the illumination. It appears
      that he abandoned this plan when he saw that there was no need
      for such an ambitious and expensive project: even the Jesuit
      fathers in Rome were convinced that the Moon's surface was
      uneven. Indeed, Galileo never returned to the task of
      representing the Moon. (In the 1630s he did, however, observe
      <term target-id="luna">lunar librations</term>, which show that the
      Moon does not always keep exactly the same face turned toward
      the Earth.) Others did little better. <link document="m11979">Thomas Harriot</link> did make a rough map of
      the full Moon but never published it. Representations by <link document="m12126">Christoph Scheiner</link>, Giuseppe Biancani, and
      Charles Malapert were little more than diagrams, useful only for
      supporting the verbal argument that the Moon's surface is rough
      and uneven. These were, so to speak, generic moons, not
      portraits of our nearest neighbor.

      If early observations and representations of the Moon were
      designed to address the issue of its mountainous nature and
      affinity with the Earth, by the 1630s the accent was
      shifting. The rough lunar surface was now accepted by
      astronomers and they turned their attention to how telescopic
      observations could help them solve the problem of <link document="m11963">longitude</link>. A lunar eclipse is an event
      that appears the same to all observers for whom the Moon is
      above the horizon (which is, of course, not the case with solar
      eclipses). As the Moon enters the Earth's shadow cone, one can
      mark the times at which the shadow crosses a particular feature
      and later compare this time with the (local) time at which a
      distant colleague observed the same event. The difference in
      local times translates directly into their difference in
      longitude.<footnote id="idp798816">24 hours=360Â°.</footnote> But
      a verbal description of the lunar feature under consideration
      was not enough. A lunar map was needed on which specific
      features could be unambiguously identified. In Aix and Provence,
      Nicholas Claude Fabri de Peiresc (still interested in the
      problem of longitude) and his friend, the astronomer Pierre
      Gassendi, decided to make a moonmap. They engaged the services
      of Claude Mellan, one of the foremost artists and engravers of
      his age. With Gassendi's sketches and guidance, Mellan engraved
      three view of the Moon, first quarter, full Moon, and last
      quarter.

      Mellan's three engravings are surely the finest artistic
      renderings of the Moon ever made, but they show an artist's
      Moon, not an astronomer's Moon. Mellan wonderfully represented
      what he saw through the telescope: at first and last quarter the
      details at the edge of the Moon are washed out while the
      features near the terminator stand out starkly; conversely, at
      full Moon the features in the center are washed out while those
      near the edge show prominent relief. Where the solar rays are
      perpendicular to the lunar surface they cast no shadows, but
      where they rake the surface they throw long shadows. What
      astronomers needed was a single map that showed all the features
      equally clearly--a composite view that pictured the Moon in a
      way it never appeared in reality but was accurate in its
      placement of individual features.
    </para>

    <para id="p11">
      The first such map was made by the Belgian cosmographer and
      astronomer Michael Florent van Langren in 1645. Two years later
      a much more influential effort was published by Johannes
      Hevelius. In 1647 Hevelius, a wealthy brewer in the Polish city
      of Gdansk, published Selenographia, the first treatise entirely
      devoted to the Moon. Hevelius combined all the talents necessary
      for his task. He made his own lenses, constructed his own
      telescopes, observed the Moon on every clear night for several
      years, drew his observations, engraved them himself, and had the
      wealth to publish a sumptuous book at his own expense. In
      Selenographia he presented engravings of every conceivable phase
      of the Moon as well as three large plates of the <link resource="hevelius_moon_r.gif">full Moon</link>: one of the ways the
      full Moon actually appeared through the telescope, one the way a
      maker of terrestrial maps might represent it (using the
      conventions of geographers), and one a composite map of all
      lunar features illuminated (impossibly) from the same side. It
      is this last map that was to be used by astronomers during lunar
      eclipses. Hevelius also suggested a system of nomenclature based
      on earthly features.
    </para>

    <para id="p12">
      Hevelius founded the science of selenography (after Selene, the
      goddess of the Moon) and showed astronomers how to represent
      heavenly bodies. Selenographia was a model for all who came
      after him. All lunar maps since his time have used the
      convention of single illumination (although while he used
      morning illumination modern maps use evening illumination after
      van Langren's model). He also instituted the practice of showing
      the entire lunar surface visible from the Earth, which, because
      of librations, is greater than a hemisphere. Hevelius's
      nomenclature, although used in Protestant countries until the
      eighteenth century, was replaced by the system published in 1651
      by the Jesuit astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli, who gave
      the large naked-eye spots the names of seas (Sea of
      Tranquillity, Sea of Storm, etc.) and the telescopic spots (now
      called craters) the name of philosophers and astronomers
      (fig. 18). It should be pointed out that although Riccioli wrote
      his Almagestum Novum ("New Almagest") in which this map appeared
      to combat the <link document="m11938">Copernican theory</link>,
      he was evenhanded in assigning names: Copernicus and Kepler were
      assigned prominent craters, and even Galileo received his due.
    </para>

    <para id="p13">
      One last note. As the astronomical <link document="m11932">telescope</link> with its inverted image came
      into use, astronomers quickly adopted the habit of <link resource="cassini_moon.gif">representing the way they saw the
      Moon--upside down</link>. This practice was followed until very
      recently. Lunar images are now constructed and stored digitally
      and can be displayed in any orientation. Astronomers have
      therefore reverted to showing the Moon right side up.
